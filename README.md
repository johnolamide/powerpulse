## About
This project PowerPulse was birthed from the need to monitor energy usage. As a person from a developing country, we are plagued with poor power supply because there is not enough energy to go round, so saving the available energy would be a great idea. Before saving energy, we need to monitor how much energy we consume on a daily basis, that is where PowerPulse comes in; it displays the Energy Usage Data for multiple homes, including the temperature and humidity values for that day.
PowerPulse is still a work in progress, with a future update that would allow a user to monitor the energy usage data in realtime.
